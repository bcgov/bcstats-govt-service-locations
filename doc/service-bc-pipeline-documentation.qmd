## Core Pipeline Scripts Methodology

### Data Preparation

*Source: `00-make-data.R`*

#### Purpose
Transforms raw external data sources into standardized intermediate files for analysis. This script serves as the foundation layer, creating all necessary data artifacts for downstream processing.

#### Methodology Overview

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" icon="false"}
## 1. Drive Time Data Processing

- **Input**: Raw CSV from DSS containing address level drive time results
- **Processing**: Column standardization, geographic identifier derivation
- **Output**: `full-processed-drivetime-data.csv` 
:::

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" icon="false"}
## 2. Geographic Boundary Creation

- **Input**: Shapefiles acquired from the BC Data Catalogue using `bcmaps` and `bcdata` at the CSD and DB level
- **Processing**: Coordinate system standardization (BC Albers EPSG:3005)
- **Outputs**: `full-db-with-location.gpkg`, `full-csd-with-location.gpkg`
:::

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" icon="false"}
## 3. Population Data Acquisition

- **Input**: Statistics Canada Census population counts (via `cansensus`) and BC Stats Population projections (via `bcdata`)
- **Processing**: Geographic linkage validation, numeric type conversion
- **Outputs**: Population files at DB and CSD geographic levels, population projections at CSD level
:::

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" icon="false"}
## 4. Crosswalk Generation

- **Input**: DB, CSD level shapefiles
- **Processing**: DB → DA → CSD linkages with descriptive names
- **Output**: `csd-da-db-loc-correspondance.csv`
:::

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" icon="false"}
## 5. Service BC Locations

- **Input**: Drivetime data, crosswalk information
- **Processing**: Create CSD level list of Service BC Locations
- **Output**: `full-service-bc-locs.csv`
:::

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" icon="false"}
## 6. Dissemination Block Population Projections

- **Input**: Population projections from BC Stats, Census Dissemination Block populations from 2021
- **Processing**: Proportional allocation method to disaggregate CSD-level projections to DB-level estimates
  - **Step 1**: Create clean CSD identifiers to match projection data (some CSDs are rolled up using '999' suffix)
  - **Step 2**: Calculate each DB's proportional share of its parent CSD's population using 2021 census data
  - **Step 3**: Apply proportional shares to future CSD projections to estimate DB-level demographics
  - **Assumption**: Each DB maintains its relative population share within the CSD over time
  - **Age/Gender Breakdown**: Transform projections from wide format (age columns) to long format with age groups
- **Output**: `full-db-projections-transformed.rds`
:::

#### Critical Dependencies
- **API Keys**: CensusMapper API key required for first-time users
- **Network Access**: BC Data Catalogue and external data sources
- **Disk Space**: Large shapefiles require significant storage

### Catchment Assignment

*Source: `03a-create-catchments.R`*

#### Purpose
Assigns every dissemination block in British Columbia to a Service BC facility catchment area using a hybrid methodology combining drive time optimization with spatial proximity fallback. These dissemination block based catchments then provide the basis for further aggregations, such as population projections and drive time estimates within each region. 

#### Methodology Overview

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" icon="false"}
## 1. Primary Assignment: Drive Time Method

- **Logic**: Each DB assigned to facility with minimum drive time for majority of addresses in the DB.
- **Data Source**: Cleaned drivetime data from DSS
- **Coverage**: Limited to addresses with successful routing solutions
:::

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" icon="false"}
## 2. Secondary Assignment: Spatial Proximity Method

- **Trigger**: Applied only to DBs without drive time assignments
- **Logic**: Assigns each DB to a facility based on shortest Euclidean distance from DB centroid to facility coordinates
- **Data Source**: DB level geography file, previously assigned list of DBs
- **Purpose**: Ensure complete provincial coverage
:::


#### Key Outputs
- **Primary**: `complete-db-assignments.csv` - Complete provincial assignments of DBs to Service BC facilities
- **Quality Control**: `unassigned-dbs-summary.csv` - Assignment method statistics
- **Diagnostics**: `unassigned-dbs.csv` - Detailed list of problematic areas

### CSD-Level Output Tables

*Source: `05a-csd-data-tables.R`*

#### Purpose
Generates final output tables aggregated at the Census Subdivision (municipal) level, incorporating drive time statistics, population data, and demographic projections for strategic planning and Service BC operational analysis. Produces standardized CSV output for Service BC stakeholders.

#### Methodology Overview

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" icon="false"}
## 1. Data Sources and Processing

This step utilizes intermediate datasets created earlier in the [Data Preparation](#data-preparation) and [Catchment Assignment](#catchment-assignment) processes.

- **Geographic Crosswalk**: `csd-da-db-loc-correspondance.csv` - Links DB → DA → CSD geographies covering 751 CSDs
- **Population Projections**: `full-db-projections-transformed.rds` - Contains DB-level projections filtered for total gender ('T') and years 2025, 2030, 2035
- **Drivetime Data**: `full-processed-drivetime-data.csv` - Processed from DSS raw data, containing 2,052,803 address records across 41,991 DBs and 525 CSDs
- **Catchment Assignments**: DB-to-facility assignments that inform the service accessibility calculations

**Data Coverage Notes**: 
  - Census data contains 52,387 DBs vs 52,423 in BC Geographic Warehouse (36 missing DBs around Vancouver Island/Lower Mainland)
  - Drive data covers 525 of 751 CSDs, missing data primarily for Indigenous Reserve Lands (220/423), Regional District Areas (3/160), and Special Economic areas (3/3)

- `rural_residents` - Numeric field initialized to 0 for rural population metrics
:::

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" icon="false"}
## 3. Final CSD-Level Integration
Calculated metrics are combined into a single comprehensive dataset by Census Subdivision and/or region level. Population projections and demographics serve as the foundation, with service accessibility metrics and rural classification placeholders integrated to create a complete analytical framework. This integration maintains complete provincial coverage across all 751 CSDs while highlighting that detailed service data is available for 525 CSDs where drive time analysis was possible.
:::

#### Key Outputs

**Primary Output**: `csd-statistics-for-SBC.csv` - Comprehensive CSD-level table written to `{TABLES_OUT}` directory containing all calculated metrics above plus geographic identifiers (CSD name, ID, regional classification)

**Coverage**: Complete provincial dataset with 751 CSDs, including both urban centers with full service metrics and rural/remote areas with population projections only

## Configuration Settings (settings.R)

The file `settings.R` contains the settings for the project, including global constants (written in all caps) and the paths to the data files. These constants are used throughout the project to ensure consistency and simplify configuration.

#### General Project Settings

-   **CSD_NAMES**: A list of municipalities of interest for the analysis (`Langford`, `Dawson Creek`, `Smithers`, `Kamloops`). This constant is used extensively throughout the project to filter data and focus analyses on these specific localities.
-   **CSDIDS**: The numeric census subdivision IDs corresponding to the municipalities in CSD_NAMES.
-   **CENSUS_BASIS**: The census year used for the analysis (2021). This defines which year's data files and statistics are used.
-   **CANCENSUS_YEAR**: The formatted census year string (`CA21`) for use with the `cancensus` package. Automatically constructed from CENSUS_BASIS.
-   **CURRENT_YEAR**: The current analysis year (2025).

#### File and Directory Paths

-   **LAN_FOLDER**: The base folder for the project, configured using the `safepaths::use_network_path()` function. This provides a consistent root directory for all data resources.
-   **SRC_DATA_FOLDER**: The folder containing processed source data files, a subfolder of the LAN_FOLDER. These are intermediate files produced by the pipeline.
-   **RAW_DATA_FOLDER**: The folder containing unprocessed input data files, a subfolder of the LAN_FOLDER.
-   **DT_DATA_FOLDER**: The folder containing raw drive time data collected for the nearest facility analysis (`nearest-facility-BC`).
-   **SBCLOC_FILEPATH**: Path to the file containing Service BC office locations.
-   **SHAPEFILE_OUT**: Destination folder where processed geospatial shapefiles are saved after processing.
-   **MAP_OUT**: Destination folder where map visualizations (PNG, SVG files) are saved for reporting.
-   **VISUALS_OUT**: Base folder for all visualization outputs, including maps and charts.
-   **TABLES_OUT**: Destination folder where tabular outputs like summary statistics are saved.
-   **FOR_SBC_OUT**: Output folder for Service BC-specific outputs.

#### File Naming and Path Patterns

-   **NO_ERRS_FILE_PATTERN**: Regular expression pattern (`no_errors.csv`) used to identify valid drive time files without errors.
-   **INPUT_ADDR_DA_PATTERN**: Pattern (`address_with_da.*`) for identifying address files with dissemination area information.

#### Data Columns and Tags

-   **REQUIRED_COLS**: The required column names in the input data files, including spatial coordinates and drive metrics (`site_albers_x`, `site_albers_y`, `dissemination_block_id`, `drv_time_sec`, `drv_dist`, `tag`).
-   **POP_COLS**: Column names for population-related data (`region_name`, `area_sq_km`, `population`, `dwellings`, `households`).
-   **FACILITY_TAG**: Identifier tag (`servicebc`) used to filter rows related specifically to Service BC locations.

#### Visualization Settings

-   **MAP_THEME**: A predefined ggplot2 theme object for map visualizations, ensuring consistent styling across all maps in the project. Specifies text sizes, positioning, grid appearance, and other aesthetic properties.
-   **BOX_PLOT_THEME**: Theme settings specifically optimized for box plots, including rotated x-axis labels for better readability.
-   **VIOLIN_PLOT_THEME**: Theme settings specifically optimized for violin plots, similar to box plot theme but with specialized settings.
-   **SCATTER_PLOT_THEME**: A variant of BOX_PLOT_THEME, with x-axis text not rotated, for scatter plots.
-   **FILL_THEME**: A predefined scale for continuous color fills using the viridis color palette (`mako` option), with specified alpha transparency and handling for NA values.
-   **FILL_THEME_D**: A similar fill scale but optimized for discrete (categorical) data.
-   **COLOR_THEME_D**: A discrete color scale for line and point colorings using the viridis palette.

#### Project Dependencies

-   The project requires several R packages, including: `safepaths`, `glue`, `tidyverse`, `janitor`, `snakecase`, `ggplot2`, `scales`, `readxl`, `sf`, `bcdata`, `tigris`, `spatstat`, `stars`, `terra`, `fs`, `ggnewscale`, `bcmaps`, `rmapshaper`, and `e1071`. These are loaded in `settings.R` and are required for the scripts to function.

## Raw to Ready Data (00-make-data.R)

The file `00-make-data.R` prepares the data required for subsequent analysis, such as visuals and tables. It reads, transforms, and writes a variety of data sources, effectively creating a project “data lake” on the LAN. The script processes raw input files, generates shapefiles, creates crosswalks, and produces both full-province and municipality-specific (“reduced”) outputs for efficient downstream use.

#### Drive Time Data Preparation

-   Reads the consolidated drive time data file (`final_result_no_errors.csv`) from the LAN, cleans column names, renames key columns for consistency, and derives dissemination area IDs (daid) from dissemination block IDs (dbid).
-   The processed drive time data is saved as `full-processed-drivetime-data.csv` and, after filtering for the municipalities of interest, as `reduced-drivetime-data.csv` in the source data folder.

#### Shapefiles

-   Generates shapefiles for Census Subdivisions (CSDs) and Dissemination Blocks (DBs) using the `bcmaps` and `bcdata` packages.
-   Writes both full-province shapefiles (`full-csd_with_location.gpkg`, `full-db_with_location.gpkg`) and reduced shapefiles for the four municipalities of interest (`reduced-csd-with-location.gpkg`, `reduced-db-with-location.gpkg`) to the shapefile output folder.
-   Additionally, creates exploratory shapefiles for Statistics Canada population centers and FSAs, saved as GeoPackage files for reference.

#### Crosswalks

-   Constructs a correspondence file (`csd-da-db-loc-correspondance.csv`) linking DBs, DAs, and CSDs, including names and types, for all of BC.
-   Builds a crosswalk for only the DBs present in the drive time data, joining with the correspondence file for hierarchical relationships.

#### Population Data

-   Retrieves population data for DBs and CSDs from the `cancensus` package, cleans and selects relevant columns, and writes out as `full-population-db.csv` and `full-population-csd.csv`.
-   Filters and writes reduced population files for the municipalities of interest (`reduced-population-db.csv`, `reduced-population-csd.csv`).
-   **API Key Requirement**: The first time a user runs this script, they will need a CensusMapper API key. Users can obtain a free key by signing up at [CensusMapper](https://censusmapper.ca/). Once obtained, the key should be set using:

``` r
cancensus::set_cancensus_api_key('YOUR_API_KEY', install = TRUE)
```

This will store the key in the user's R environment for future use. API quotas are generally sufficient for standard analysis, but users performing extensive operations may need to request higher limits.

#### Population Projections

-   Downloads CSD-level population projections from BC Data Catalogue, cleans and standardizes region codes.
-   Allocates CSD projections to DBs by calculating the proportion of each DB within its CSD, assuming these proportions remain constant over time.
-   Joins projections to DBs and transforms age columns into rows, creating age groups for analysis.
-   Saves the resulting DB-level projections as `full_db_projections_transformed.rds` and the raw projections as `full-population-projections.csv`.

#### Service BC Location Data

-   Extracts Service BC office locations by joining processed drive time data with the crosswalk, and writes the full and reduced sets as `full-service-bc-locs.csv` and `reduced-service_bc_locs.csv`.
-   Coordinates are stored in the Albers equal-area projection (EPSG:3005).

#### Output Summary

The following key files are produced in the source and shapefile output folders:

-   `full-processed-drivetime-data.csv`, `reduced-drivetime-data.csv`
-   `full-service-bc-locs.csv`, `reduced-service_bc_locs.csv`
-   `csd-da-db-loc-correspondance.csv`
-   `full-population-db.csv`, `reduced-population-db.csv`
-   `full-population-csd.csv`, `reduced-population-csd.csv`
-   `full-population-projections.csv`
-   `full_db_projections_transformed.rds`
-   `full-csd_with_location.gpkg`, `reduced-csd-with-location.gpkg`
-   `full-db_with_location.gpkg`, `reduced-db-with-location.gpkg`
-   Exploratory: `popcenter-statscan.gpkg`, `fsa-statscan.gpkg`

#### Notes

-   The script writes both full-province and reduced (municipality-specific) outputs for efficiency in downstream scripts.
-   The logic for DB-level population projections and age group transformation is implemented directly in the script.
-   At the end of the script, the R environment is cleared to free memory for subsequent processing steps.

## Descriptive Tables (01-descriptive-tables.R)

This script \`01-descriptive-tables.R\` generates comprehensive statistical summaries of drive times and distances to Service BC offices. The data is aggregated at three distinct geographic levels to support multi-scale analysis:

### Geographic Levels of Analysis

**Dissemination Block (DB)**: The smallest geographic unit for which population and dwelling counts are available (\~500-750 people). Provides the most granular view of accessibility patterns.

**Dissemination Area (DA)**: A small geographic unit composed of one or more adjacent dissemination blocks (\~400-700 people). Serves as an intermediate level of analysis.

**Census Subdivision (CSD)**: Municipal-level geography (e.g., cities, towns, villages) used for census data dissemination. Provides a broad overview of access patterns.

### Statistical Metrics Produced

For each geographic unit, the output includes:

-   **Count metrics**: Number of addresses, number of DB blocks with insufficient data
-   **Time metrics**: Drive time statistics in both seconds and minutes
-   **Distance metrics**: Drive distance statistics in kilometers
-   **Population metrics**: Area size, population count, dwelling count, household count
-   **Data quality metrics**: Counts of DB blocks with insufficient address data

These tables form the analytical foundation for all subsequent visualizations, allowing accessibility patterns to be examined at different geographic scales and in relation to population distribution.

## Thematic Maps for Accessibility Metrics

### Standard Choropleth Maps (02-map-plots.R)

The `02-map-plots.R` script generates thematic maps that visualize accessibility metrics at various geographic levels. These maps provide insights into potential disparities in service access by coloring each dissemination block based on drive time or distance.

#### Required Files

-   **Shapefiles**: Processed geographical boundaries from `SHAPEFILE_OUT` folder:
    -   Census Subdivision (CSD) level shapefiles (`reduced-csd-with-location.gpkg`)
    -   Dissemination Area (DA) level shapefiles (`reduced-da-with-location.gpkg`)
    -   Dissemination Block (DB) level shapefiles (`reduced-db-with-location.gpkg`)
-   **Statistical Data**: Aggregated metrics from the output of `01-descriptive-tables.R`:
    -   DA-level summary statistics (`reduced_da_average_times_dist_all_locs.csv`)
    -   DB-level summary statistics (`reduced_db_average_times_dist_all_locs.csv`)
    -   CSD-level summary statistics (`reduced_csd_average_times_dist_all_locs.csv`)
-   **Location Data**:
    -   Service BC office locations (`service_bc_locs.csv`)


#### Parameterization and Customization

The script implements a flexible parameterization framework for accessibility metric visualization. Parameters include metric type selection (drive_time_sec, drive_time_min, drive_dist) with unit conversion support. Geographic filtering utilizes predicate functions applied to the CSD_NAMES constant. Map metadata elements (titles, subtitles, legends) are exposed through function interfaces for contextual modification. Default parameter values ensure execution in minimal configuration scenarios.

#### Styling

Visualization styling applies predefined ggplot2 theme elements from global constants. The MAP_THEME establishes cartographic parameters for fonts, margins, and background elements. Data representation utilizes the FILL_THEME scale with a viridis-based color ramp and parametric transparency settings. Service BC locations are overlaid as spatial reference indicators with consistent symbolization. All styling adheres to accessibility standards while optimizing information density.


#### Visualization Specifics

-   **Spatial Gaps**: Some dissemination blocks may appear blank on the maps because:
    -   No addresses exist within certain blocks (e.g., parks, undeveloped areas)
    -   Insufficient data was collected for those areas
    -   The minimum threshold for address counts wasn't met
-   **Output Format**: Saves maps as SVG files in the `MAP_OUT/csd-drive-distance-maps` directory

### Smoothed Density Maps (02d-density_map.R)

The `02d-density_map.R` script addresses the spatial gaps in the standard choropleth maps by using kernel density estimation to create continuous surfaces representing drive time or distance across entire geographic areas.

#### Required Files

-   **Address Data**: Point-level drive time data (`reduced-drivetime-data.csv`)
-   **Crosswalk File**: Geographic identifier relationships (`csd-da-db-loc-crosswalk.csv`)
-   **Population Data**: DB-level population statistics (`population-db.csv`)
-   **Location Data**: Service BC office locations (`reduced-service_bc_locs.csv`)
-   **Shape Data**: CSD boundaries (retrieved dynamically from bcmaps package)

#### Parameterization and Customization

The script configures spatial kernel density estimation through parametric controls for smoothing operations. Core parameters include kernel bandwidth (sigma = 1000), grid resolution (300x300 cells), and boundary clipping to municipal extents. The implementation features a toggle for scale normalization, enabling either consistent color ranges across municipalities for comparative analysis or locally optimized ranges for enhanced local detail visibility.

#### Styling

Visualization styling leverages predefined theme elements from settings.R to maintain project-wide consistency. The MAP_THEME governs cartographic layout parameters while the FILL_THEME provides a continuous color scale based on the viridis palette. Service BC locations are programmatically rendered as reference markers with standardized symbolization to provide spatial context across all visualization outputs.


#### Visualization Specifics

-   **Spatial Smoothing**: Uses kernel density estimation via the `spatstat` package to:
    -   Convert point-based data to continuous surfaces
    -   Fill gaps between known data points with interpolated values
    -   Provide a more complete visual representation of accessibility patterns
-   **Output Format**: Saves maps as PNG files in the `MAP_OUT/csd-drive-distance-maps` directory


### Statistical Visualizations (02c-box-violin-plots.R)

The `02c-box-violin-plots.R` script generates statistical visualizations that reveal the distribution patterns of drive times or distances across different municipalities, complementing the spatial maps with comparative statistical perspectives.

#### Required Files

-   **Statistical Data**: DB-level summary statistics (`reduced_db_average_times_dist_all_locs.csv`)
-   **Configuration**: Uses constants defined in `settings.R`
-   **Plot Functions**: Relies on custom functions defined in `plots.r`

#### Parameterization and Customization

The script supports visualization of multiple numeric metrics including mean drive time (minutes), mean drive distance (kilometers), and statistical distribution measures (variance, skewness). Function parameters enable customization of plot titles and labels for analytical context. Plot type configuration allows generation of box plots, violin plots, or both based on analytical requirements and visualization objectives.

#### Styling

Visualization styling implements specialized theme constants from settings.R tailored for statistical graphics. BOX_PLOT_THEME optimizes display parameters with rotated axis labels to accommodate municipality names, while VIOLIN_PLOT_THEME provides variant settings for density distribution displays. The FILL_THEME_D discrete color scale ensures consistent municipality representation across all statistical visualizations with appropriate color differentiation for categorical data.


#### Visualization Specifics

-   **Box Plots**: Show central tendency, dispersion, and outliers
    -   Central line represents the median
    -   Box spans from first to third quartile (interquartile range)
    -   Whiskers show range of non-outlier data
-   **Violin Plots**: Display full distribution shape
    -   Width indicates frequency density at different values
    -   Shows distribution characteristics like bimodality or skewness
-   **Output Format**: Saves plots as PNG files in the `VISUALS_OUT/csd-drive-distance-plots` directory

## Future Work

-   Expand the analysis to include additional municipalities and public services.
-   Incorporate socio-economic and demographic factors into the analysis.

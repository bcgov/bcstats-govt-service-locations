This is technical documentation for the project and is **under construction**.

## Configuration Settings (setting.R)

The file `setting.R` contains the settings for the project, including global constants (written in all caps) and the paths to the data files. These constants are used throughout the project to ensure consistency and simplify configuration.

::: {style="font-size: 0.9em;"}
#### General Project Settings

-   **CSD_NAMES**: A list of municipalities of interest for the analysis (`Langford`, `Dawson Creek`, `Smithers`, `Kamloops`). This constant is used extensively throughout the project to filter data and focus analyses on these specific localities.
-   **CENSUS_BASIS**: The census year used for the analysis (2021). This defines which year's data files and statistics are used.
-   **CANCENSUS_YEAR**: The formatted census year string (`CA21`) for use with the `cancensus` package. Automatically constructed from CENSUS_BASIS.

#### File and Directory Paths

## Raw to Ready Data (00-make-data.R)

The file `00-make-data.R` prepares the data required for subsequent analysis, such as visuals and tables. It processes raw input files, generates shape files, and creates crosswalks for different geographic units.

1.  **Pre-processing Driving distance data files**:

    The script utilizes the `preprocess_locs` function to handle raw drive time files. Originally, this function was designed to handle separate data files for each municipality, cleaning and extracting relevant columns before merging them together. While the current dataset now arrives as a single consolidated file, the function has been maintained for compatibility with the existing pipeline structure to avoid extensive refactoring. The function:

    -   Reads the raw CSV data
    -   Cleans column names using `janitor::clean_names()`
    -   Filters for rows matching the specified tag (typically 'servicebc')
    -   Renames key columns for consistency ('site_albers_x' to 'address_albers_x', etc.)
    -   Derives dissemination area IDs (daid) from dissemination block IDs (dbid

    The processed data is then consolidated and saved to the `SRC_DATA_FOLDER` for use in subsequent analysis steps.

2.  **Shapefiles**:

    Shapefiles for Census Subdivisions (CSDs), Dissemination Areas (DAs), and Dissemination Blocks (DBs) are created using the `bcmaps` and `bcdata` packages. Two sets of shapefiles are generated:

    -   **Full shapefiles**: Contain geographic boundaries for all areas across British Columbia. These comprehensive files serve as the master reference but can be computationally intensive to work with.

    -   **Reduced shapefiles**: Filtered to include only the four municipalities of interest (Langford, Dawson Creek, Smithers, Kamloops). These optimized files significantly improve processing efficiency for visualization and analysis tasks.

    All shapefiles are saved to the `SHAPEFILE_OUT` folder in GPKG (GeoPackage) format, which offers better performance and compression than traditional shapefiles.

3.  **Crosswalk**:

    A crosswalk is created to link dissemination blocks (DBs) to dissemination areas (DAs) and Census Subdivisions (CSDs). This crosswalk is used to aggregate data at different geographic levels. Two crosswalk files are generated:

    **Correspondence file**: Contains all DB's in BC with their hierarchical relationships

    **Crosswalk file**: Contains only the DBs used in the analysis with links to higher geographic levels. This may become obsolete as the correspondence file retains the full picture of BC.

4.  **Population Data**:

    -   Population data for DAs, DBs, and CSDs is retrieved using the `cancensus` package. The data is pruned and cleaned and saved for use in later scripts.

    -   **API Key Requirement**: The first time a user runs this script, they will need a CensusMapper API key. Users can obtain a free key by signing up at [CensusMapper](https://censusmapper.ca/). Once obtained, the key should be set using:

    ``` r
    cancensus::set_cancensus_api_key('YOUR_API_KEY', install = TRUE)
    ```

    This will store the key in the user's R environment for future use. API quotas are generally sufficient for standard analysis, but users performing extensive operations may need to request higher limits.

    Similar to shapefiles, both full (province-wide) and reduced (municipalities of interest only) versions are created for computational efficiency.

5.  **Service BC Location Data**:

    An aggregated data set containing the count of addresses considered "nearest" to each Service BC location is saved. Coordinates are stored in the Albers equal-area projection (EPSG:3005), which is specifically optimized for British Columbia.

6.  **Output Files**:

    The processed data is saved in both full and reduced formats (filtered by the municipalities of interest) for use in subsequent scripts. Consistent naming conventions with "full-" and "reduced-" prefixes help distinguish between province-wide and municipality-specific datasets.

## Descriptive Tables (01-descriptive-tables.R)

This script generates comprehensive statistical summaries of drive times and distances to Service BC offices. The data is aggregated at three distinct geographic levels to support multi-scale analysis:

### Geographic Levels of Analysis

1.  **Dissemination Block (DB)**: The smallest geographic unit for which population and dwelling counts are available (\~500-750 people). Provides the most granular view of accessibility patterns.

2.  **Dissemination Area (DA)**: A small geographic unit composed of one or more adjacent dissemination blocks (\~400-700 people). Serves as an intermediate level of analysis.

3.  **Census Subdivision (CSD)**: Municipal-level geography (e.g., cities, towns, villages) used for census data dissemination. Provides a broad overview of access patterns.

### Statistical Metrics Produced

For each geographic unit, the output includes:

-   **Count metrics**: Number of addresses, number of DB blocks with insufficient data
-   **Time metrics**: Drive time statistics in both seconds and minutes
-   **Distance metrics**: Drive distance statistics in kilometers
-   **Population metrics**: Area size, population count, dwelling count, household count
-   **Data quality metrics**: Counts of DB blocks with insufficient address data

These tables form the analytical foundation for all subsequent visualizations, allowing accessibility patterns to be examined at different geographic scales and in relation to population distribution.

## Thematic Maps for Accessibility Metrics

### Standard Choropleth Maps (02-map-plots.R)

The `02-map-plots.R` script generates thematic maps that visualize accessibility metrics at various geographic levels. These maps provide insights into potential disparities in service access by coloring each dissemination block based on drive time or distance.

**Required files:** Include the boundaries for Census Subdivisions (CSDs), Dissemination Areas (DAs), and Dissemination Blocks (DBs) and aggregated metrics from the output of `01-descriptive-tables.R.`

**Geographic Focus**: Filters data to include only the municipalities of interest (`Langford`, `Dawson Creek`, `Smithers`, `Kamloops`).

**Customizable Metrics**: Different accessibility metrics are available for visualization including; mean drive times (in seconds or minutes), mean drive distances (in kilometers), address counts (population coverage) and others.

**Spatial Gaps**: Some dissemination blocks may appear blank on the maps because either no addresses exist within certain blocks (e.g., parks, undeveloped areas) or the data was collected for those areas.

### Smoothed Density Maps (02d-density_map.R)

The `02d-density_map.R` script addresses the spatial gaps in the standard choropleth maps by using kernel density estimation to create continuous surfaces representing drive time or distance. This approach generates more visually complete maps by interpolating values across the entire geographic area.

**Spatial Smoothing**: Kernel density estimation via the `spatstat` package is used to convert point-based data to continuous surfaces and fill gaps in DB's with interpolated values. They provide an alternative and in some cases more complete visual representation of accessibility patterns.

**Technical Approach**: Address points with drive time/distance values are converted into spatial point patterns. Smoothing applied, with a specified bandwidth (sigma = 1000). A high-resolution grid (300x300) is used for the smoothed surface which is clipped to the municipality boundary.

**Parameterization**:

-   Supports consistent scaling across municipalities for comparability
-   Allows custom color scales through the `FILL_THEME` setting
-   Includes standard map elements like titles, legends, and Service BC locations

Both mapping approaches are complementary, with the standard choropleth maps providing precise block-level statistics and the smoothed maps offering a more complete spatial representation of accessibility patterns.

### Mapping Pilot Municipalities (02b-plot-localities.R)

The `02b-plot-localities.R` script creates a map that highlights the pilot municipalities (`Langford`, `Dawson Creek`, `Smithers`, `Kamloops`) and plots the locations of Service BC offices. This map provides a high-level overview of the geographic distribution of the selected localities.

#### **Key Features**

-   **BC Base Map**: Uses the `bcmaps` package to generate a map of British Columbia, transformed to CRS 3005.

-   **Data Integration**:

    -   **Shapefiles**: Processed CSD shapefiles from `SHAPEFILE_OUT`.

    -   **Service BC Locations**: CSV file containing the geographic coordinates of Service BC offices.

-   **Custom Visualizations**:

    -   **Pilot Regions Map**: A map showing the pilot municipalities and their Service BC locations.

    -   **Centroid Adjustments**: Calculates and adjusts centroids for municipality labels to avoid overlap.

    -   **Service BC Locations**: Plots Service BC offices as yellow markers on the map.

-   **File Location**: The map is saved as `pilot_regions.png` in the `MAP_OUT` folder.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Statistical Visualizations (02c-box-violin-plots.R)

While the thematic maps provide spatial representations of accessibility metrics, the `02c-box-violin-plots.R` script generates statistical visualizations that reveal the distribution patterns of drive times or distances across different municipalities. These plots complement the spatial maps by providing a comparative statistical perspective on service accessibility.

#### Available Visualization Types

1.  **Box Plots**: Show the central tendency, dispersion, and potential outliers in drive time/distance distributions.
    -   Central line represents the median
    -   Box spans from the first quartile (25th percentile) to the third quartile (75th percentile)
    -   Whiskers extend to the range of non-outlier data points
    -   Individual points represent actual data values (address locations)
2.  **Violin Plots**: Combine box plot characteristics with kernel density estimation to show the full distribution shape.
    -   Width of the "violin" indicates frequency density at different values
    -   Allows visual comparison of probability density across municipalities
    -   Shows whether distributions are bimodal, skewed, or have unusual features

#### Implementation Details

-   **Data Source**: Uses the aggregated statistics from the `01-descriptive-tables.R` script, primarily at the dissemination block level for greatest detail.

-   **Customizable Variables**: Can visualize any numeric metric present in the dataset:

    -   Mean drive time (minutes)
    -   Mean drive distance (kilometers)
    -   Population density
    -   Other statistical measures (variance, skewness, etc.)

-   **Consistent Styling**: Leverages the predefined theme constants from `settings.R`:

    -   `BOX_PLOT_THEME`: Specialized theme with rotated x-axis labels for better readability
    -   `VIOLIN_PLOT_THEME`: Similar theme adapted for violin plots
    -   `FILL_THEME_D`: Discrete color scale for distinguishing between municipalities

-   **Functionality**: Implemented through specialized functions in plots.R:

    -   `build_boxplot()`: Configurable function for generating box plots
    -   `build_violinplot()`: Corresponding function for violin plots

These statistical visualizations are particularly valuable for: - Comparing accessibility across different municipalities - Identifying municipalities with greater disparity in service access - Detecting unusual patterns that might not be apparent from maps alone - Providing quantifiable metrics for policy decisions

All outputs are saved to the `VISUALS_OUT` directory with systematic naming conventions based on the plot type and variables visualized.

## Future Work

-   Expand the analysis to include additional municipalities and public services.
-   Incorporate socio-economic and demographic factors into the analysis.
-   Improve the documentation for each script and function.

## Project Description

This repository houses R code for analyzing the current geographic location of essential public services (e.g., Service BC locations, hospitals and schools) in British Columbia. Using spatial analysis techniques, the code scripts calculate accessibility metrics, aggregated at both the municipal level and by smaller geographic units (i.e. Census Dissemination Areas (DAs) or Dissemination Blocks (DBs)).  Accessibility metrics are based on factors such as population density distribution, facility locations, and travel times (initially by car).

The primary goal is to identify potential geographic disparities in service access, highlighting potentially underserved populations or underutilized facilities. The derived data tables and visualizations provide quantitative insights to support service planning, resource allocation, and equitable service delivery strategies.  They allow for for analysis focused on specific targeted municipalities or regions of interest.

The first phase of the project focuses on the drive times to Service BC locations for four municipalities (Smithers, Langford, Kamloops and Dawson Creek), with plans to expand to other public services in future phases. The analysis will be conducted at the Dissemination Block (DB) level, with the option to aggregate results to larger geographic units as needed.

*Note: The code and analytical methodology are currently under development.*
 
## Secure Data Access

Accessing project files and data requires the [`safepaths`](https://github.com/bcgov/safepaths) R package. This package securely manages the LAN paths to the data, abstracting sensitive location details from the user. VPN connection is required to use and configure `safepaths` as well as the LAN location of all data files. 

## Installation and Usage

**R:** This project requires a recent version of R (4.0.0 or later).

**R Packages:** Install required packages using:

```R
# Manually install packages:
install.packages(c("sf", "tidyverse", "glue", "janitor", "e1071", "remotes"))
remotes::install_github("bcgov/safepaths")
```

**Safepaths Configuration:** Follow the [safepaths package documentation](https://github.com/bcgov/safepaths) for initial setup. You will need the project's specific LAN path key from the project maintainers to configure access to the required datasets.

## Data Sources

This analysis relies on the following primary data sources:

**Geocoded Address Points (via BC Geocoder API)**

Geographic coordinates for project-relevant addresses were generated using the British Columbia Physical Address Geocoder REST API service ([https://geocoder.api.gov.bc.ca/](https://geocoder.api.gov.bc.ca/)). This API performs address validation and returns point location data (latitude/longitude or projected coordinates). The output dataset utilized in this project includes these derived coordinates along with the corresponding Statistics Canada Dissemination Block (DB) identifier (blockID field from the API response), enabling spatial linkage. Records returned by the geocoder that lacked valid coordinates were excluded from the analysis dataset.

While the source address list input to the geocoder is restricted under license, the derived geocoded point coordinates used the analysis are open. 

**NFA Data:** 

(Description pending - this dataset represents output from the Nearest Facility Analysis pipeline, details to be added.)

**Geographic Concordance File**

A geographic concordance file was acquired from Statistics Canada ([statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/geo/sip-pis/dguid-idugd/index2021-eng.cfm?year=21](statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/geo/sip-pis/dguid-idugd/index2021-eng.cfm?year=21)) to facilitate data linkage across disparate census geographic hierarchies (e.g., linking Dissemination Areas to Census Subdivisions). This file enables the aggregation or translation of data between administrative or statistical units. Note: This dataset has been acquired but not yet implemented in the current analysis workflow.

**Digital Boundary Files**

Digital boundary files in Shapefile format (.shp), defining the geographic extents of Population Centers (PC), Dissemination Areas (DAs) and Dissemination Blocks (DBs), were obtained from Statistics Canada ([https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/geo/sip-pis/boundary-limites/index2021-eng.cfm?year=21](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/geo/sip-pis/boundary-limites/index2021-eng.cfm?year=21)). These vector datasets served as the geometric base for cartographic visualization and underpinning geospatial operations within the analysis.

**Census Population and Dwelling Counts**

Aggregate population and dwelling count data at the Dissemination Area (DA) level were extracted from the Statistics Canada 2021 Census profile tables ([https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=9810001502&geocode=A000259](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=9810001502&geocode=A000259) - Table 98-10-0015-02]. This dataset provided the foundational demographic inputs for calculating population density metrics and deriving other relevant socio-spatial indicators for the designated study regions.

## Guiding Principles

This project operates under the following guidelines:

1.  This GitHub repository stores only code. All data resides on secure LAN storage accessed via `safepaths`.
2.  The analysis utilizes data that contain no Personal Information (PI) or other sensitive information.  
3.  In line with BC Government digital principles, the analytic code is developed openly to promote transparency and reproducibility.

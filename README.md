## Data Sources

This project uses data from the following sources:

**Geocoder/NFA data output (incomplete)** 

Includes the Dissemintaion Block id but can add any admin boundary id if requested 
Addresses that did not have valid coordinates or are not connected to the road network were (fixed/removed - confirm). 


The original address data used by the geocoder is restricted under licencing, however the output is open source. As such, we have not included any of the source data in this project.  

**Dissemination Geographies Relationship File (not used yet)**

A mapping file was (along with related correspondence files) was used to cross-reference and integrate data across different geographic hierarchy. In particular from CSD to DA's. The files were sourced from Statistics Canada and downloaded from: https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/geo/sip-pis/dguid-idugd/index2021-eng.cfm?year=21

**Dissemination Area Boundary Files**

Boundary Shape Files (.shp) for Dissemination Areas (DAs) and Dissemination Blocks (DBs) were sourced from Statistics Canada.  These files were used to create maps and perform spatial analysis.  The shape files were downloaded from: https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/geo/sip-pis/boundary-limites/index2021-eng.cfm?year=21

**Population Data**

Population and dwelling counts for selected dissemination areas were sourced from Statistics Canadaâ€™s 2021 Census.  This data was used to calculate population density and other demographic statistics.  The data was downloaded from: https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=9810001502&geocode=A000259

# Script: 03a-create-catchments.R

# Description: This script assigns every dissemination block (DB) to a 
# catchment area, first using drive time data and then using spatial 
# proximity for any unassigned DBs. It saves the results to a CSV file 
# for use in subsequent scripts.

# Requirements:
#   - Requires R packages: `tidyverse`, `glue`, `janitor`, `sf`
#   - Depends on `settings.R` for paths and constants
#   - Requires the assignment functions from `calculations.r`
#   - Requires input DB shapefiles and drive time data

# Side Effects/Outputs:
#   - Saves complete DB assignments to a CSV file in the TABLES_OUT folder
#   - Saves assignment statistics to a CSV file in the TABLES_OUT folder
